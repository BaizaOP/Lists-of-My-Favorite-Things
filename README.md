# Lists-of-My-Favorite-Things
Hello! This is my first Github Repo where I will make a website every so often! I hope you enjoy!
The website is about all of my favorite, and not favorite things. I chose this because it was simple for my first website, but would also create plenty of content to fill the website with. Good for allowing me to test the waters of web development.

Dev Log:
As of pi day 2020, I changed to Notepad++ and I love it!!!!!!
