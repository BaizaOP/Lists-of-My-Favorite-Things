			<!--THE COWBOY BEBOP SECTION-->

			<h3 class="animesubheading" id="CowboyBebop">Cowboy Bebop</h3>
			<p class="animetext"> Though this is an anime that I have finished just recently, it has already been placed on my list of favorite anime. It is a hilarious anime with just enough action 
			not to be considered a thriller, but enough to keep me entertained. Though this series is on the odder end, this series is odd in the best ways possible, if that even is possible. The 
			character creation and the air of mystery that the series and its characters have is nothing I have ever seen before. Take for example Ed’s father, you get so confused, but when it's over, 
			everything makes sense! And the way the characters hint at things episodes in advance almost makes you think that the writers started with the end of the story and ended at the beginning, 
			which could be possible. Anyway, I would most definitely recommend this to any anime fan who can handle the maturity of it.</p>
				
			<!--THE HI SCORE GIRL SECTION-->

			<h3 class="animesubheading" id="HiScoreGirl">Hi Score Girl</h3>
			<div class="animetext">
				<p>All of the anime on this list has been a favorite of mine at least once, and I have to say, besides maybe KHR (which I didn't put on this list because it has been too long since I 
				have seen it, to remember where I stand with it. But KHR is still worth a watch), this has been my favorite anime for the longest time. This is a truly stunning anime. Like, I get tingly 
				just thinking about it. Holy crap. First off, the mangaka was an amazing writer. The way that the plot develops and the way he creates his characters is truly stunning</p>

				<p>STORYTIME!: At first, when this popped up on Netflix, I was like, "what the crap is this?" I watched a few seconds and then skipped right over it to another show. Maybe a year after 
				this, I went to a camp where there was an anime club. In that club, we had to watch an episode of this anime. It was so good that the class elected to watch this show three times in a row. 
				I also remember that after it came out that I had binged the 11 or 12 episodes that were left all in one night. It was wonderful.</p>
				<p>Getting back to the review, this mangaka is a wizard. He was able to incorporate not just an interesting plot with the clashing between the main character and the girl that’s better than 
				him, but also a love triangle and some edge of your seat moments. Truly amazing.</p>

			<!--THE KENICHI SECTION-->

			<h3 class="animesubheading" id="Kenichi">Kenichi</h3>
			<p class="animetext">Kenichi is awesome. Honestly, I am just a fan of fighting anime in general, which is weird because this is the only one on there. In particular, I have always been a fan 
			of the training in anime, like the milk delivery scene in Dragon Ball. And, quite frankly, this anime is full of them. Basically, this anime is all about this kid training to become stronger, 
			and in becoming stronger, he meets really strong people, making him have to become ever stronger, and the cycle goes on. It is amazing. There isn’t much to say about this one. You will like this 
			one if you like fighting, humor and good storylines.</p>
			
			<!-- TOKYO GHOUL SECTION -->
			<h3 class="animesubheading" id="TokyoGhoul">Tokyo Ghoul</h3>
			<img id="TokyoGhoulImg" src="images/TokyoGhoulImg.jfif" alt="An image of Kaneki Ken from Tokyo Ghoul.">

			<!--THE SAIKI SECTION-->

			<h3 class="animesubheading" id="Saiki">The Disastrous Life of Saiki K</h3>
			<p class="animetext">I love this show. I feel like I can sympathize with this dude. He just wants to be an average dude, but he was born with psychic abilities. Think One Punch Man but in the 
			body of a schoolboy with psychic powers and pink hair. But it's not just this. Saiki K also has romance, action, and comedy aspects. Honestly, to best understand this show, one has to watch this 
			show. (And because it is on Netflix, anyone can watch it) But because you somehow arrived here, let me go more in-depth (Mild Spoiler Warning):

			Saiki Kusuo was born with special psychic powers, which include telepathy, teleportation, and telekinesis. But unlike most children born with superpowers, he didn’t quite want these powers. 
			Instead, he wished he was a normal boy because of the hardship he has been through. I won’t explain why, but he has had to relive a certain portion of his life over and over again. And because 
			of this, he has longed to become a regular human. Even when he got the chance, he felt that it was his duty to fix wrong, and tried to get them back again. It is truly a stunning dynamic. Though 
			because of his psychic powers, he has felt that bad things have gravitated towards him. Overall, great watch to ALL ANIME LOVERS!!

			<h2 class="animeheadings"> List Two - Lists of Favorite Manga: </h2>
			<div class="animetext">
				<p>I am a newbie to this category as I have just started reading manga. But I can say that I have a very deep love for a certain few series. Unlike anime though, I will share my top three manga,
				in no order:</p>
				
				<p>	TL;DR:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="#CONANSAN">Case Closed/Detective Conan</a></li>
					<li>Dragon Ball Franchise</li>
					<li>Boruto</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			
			<!-- THE CASE CLOSED SECTION -->
	
			<h3 id="CONANSAN" class="animesubheading">Case Closed/Detective Conan</h3>
			<p class="animetext">Like all of the reviews before this one, I must start by saying: This series is AMAZING. And I am not lying. Conan, which is the Japanese translated name of this anime is amazing. 
			Now,  I am not claiming to be knowledgeable in ALL of Conan, but I have read approximately half of the tankobon (Which is about 45 volumes, by the way). Though the series can be a bit… repetitive at times, 
			it is worth every single volume. And you can believe me when I say this because I have read 45 volumes. The story is interesting and funny, the plot gets really intriguing and all in all, it's worth the hype. 
			It is the gold standard of mystery manga. Now for a summary of the seasons. (No spoilers here as all of this happens in the first few chapters.):
			<br><br>
			Detective Conan or Case Closed in western countries is the story of Jimmy Kudo a high school detective who has been injected with a drug that has reverted him back into a first grader. From there, he assumes 
			the name, Conan Edogawa. Conan, hence the title, moves to live with his crush, Rachel, back when he was still Jimmy, and her father, Richard Moore. Now, Conan tries to find the organization that shrunk him and 
			helps Richard with being a Private Investigator.
			<br><br>
			Overall, this is a great show for teens, even though it seems like a kid show, as some of the scenes can be frightening and suspenseful. Though it's a great show for all Anime fans!
